## Problem Statement: Estimating the Risk of Funding a Consumer's Purchase or Dealing with a Merchant

# Context

Financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech companies need to accurately assess the risk associated with funding consumer purchases and onboarding merchants. A failure to correctly estimate risk can lead to increased loan defaults, fraud, and financial losses.

This challenge requires a machine learning-driven risk assessment system that can dynamically score consumers and merchants based on historical data, transaction behaviors, and financial trends.

# Key Challenges
- Consumer Credit Risk:

How to predict whether a consumer will default on a payment?
How to balance frictionless payments while minimizing risk?

Merchant Risk Evaluation:

How to assess the credibility of a merchant before onboarding?
How to detect high-risk businesses that may engage in fraudulent activities?

Fraud Detection:

How prevent fraudulent transactions while allowing legitimate ones?
How to identify suspicious transaction patterns in real time?

Regulatory Compliance:

How to ensure risk assessment aligns with financial regulations?
How to apply explainable AI (XAI) for transparency in decisions?
