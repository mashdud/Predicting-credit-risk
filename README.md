## Problem Statement: Estimating the Risk of Funding a Consumer's Purchase or Dealing with a Merchant

# Context

Financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech companies need to accurately assess the risk associated with funding consumer purchases and onboarding merchants. A failure to correctly estimate risk can lead to increased loan defaults, fraud, and financial losses.

This challenge requires a machine learning-driven risk assessment system that can dynamically score consumers and merchants based on historical data, transaction behaviors, and financial trends.
